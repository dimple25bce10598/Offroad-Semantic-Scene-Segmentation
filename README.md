# Offroad-Semantic-Scene-Segmentation
Offroad Semantic Scene Segmentation implements a PyTorch-based deep learning pipeline for pixel-level segmentation of off-road environments. Trained on synthetic desert data, the model classifies terrain elements such as vegetation, rocks, ground clutter, and sky, and is evaluated on unseen environments using IoU metrics.
